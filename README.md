## Description

From Part 1 Introduction:

> "In this codelab, you'll create a simple mobile Flutter app. If you're familiar with object-oriented code and basic programming concepts—such as variables, loops, and conditionals—then you can complete the codelab. You don't need previous experience with Dart, mobile, or web programming.

> You'll implement a simple app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates 10 names at a time. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll."

From Part 2 Introduction:

> "In this codelab, you'll extend a basic, mobile Flutter app to include interactivity. You'll also create a second page (called a route) that the user can navigate to. Finally, you'll modify the app's theme (color).

> You'll start with a simple mobile app that generates an endless list of proposed names for a startup company. By the end of the codelab, your end users can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. Tapping the list icon in the upper right of the app bar navigates to a new page (called a route) that lists only the favorited names."
